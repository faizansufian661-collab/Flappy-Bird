Unlike the classic infinite runner, **Flappy Adventure** features a structured campaign. Players must navigate through 50 Sections, each containing 5 Levels. As you progress, the game becomes faster and the gaps between pipes become tighter.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Campaign Mode**: 250 unique levels split across 50 sections.
- **Save System**: Built-in Login/Signup (Local Storage) to save your level progress.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: 
  - Beautiful gradients that change per section (Sky, Sunset, Purple, Green, Pink).
  - Fully animated Bird with physics-based rotation and "googly eyes".
  - Cinematic Splash Screen entry.
- **Responsive Gameplay**: The game engine scales intelligently to fit any screen size (Mobile & Desktop) while maintaining precise physics.
- **Smooth Physics**: Custom gravity and jump logic for a "buttery smooth" feel.
